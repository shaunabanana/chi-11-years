abstract = {With substantial efforts in ubiquitous computing, ICT4D, and sustainable interaction
design, among others, HCI is increasingly engaging with matters of social change that
go beyond the immediate qualities of interaction. In doing so, HCI takes on scientific
and moral concerns. This paper explores the potential for feminist social science
to contribute to and potentially benefit from HCI's rising interest in social change.
It describes how feminist contributions to debates in the philosophy of science have
helped clarify relationships among objectivity, values, data collection and interpretation,
and social consequences. Feminists have proposed and implemented strategies to pursue
scientific and moral agendas together and with equal rigor. In this paper, we assess
the epistemologies, methodologies, and methods of feminist social science relative
to prior and ongoing research efforts in HCI. We conclude by proposing an outline
of a feminist HCI methodology.},

abstract = {"Out there" is increasingly becoming a topic of concern in HCI. Thanks to various
clarion calls, researchers in the field are turning their attention to technology-mediated
activities that are shaped less by Euro-American sensibilities and defined more by
how they are culturally and geographically distinct. Fieldwork and ethnography researchers,
for instance, are beginning to investigate ICT use at religious and spiritual sites,
by the socially excluded and disenfranchised, and by people in developing regions.
In this paper, I concentrate on the latter focus on development to reflect on HCI's
disciplinary turn "out there". Specifically, I take the following three themes as
common rhetorical devices in such work: (i) the network, (ii) difference and (iii)
complexity. Through examples, I discuss how each of these themes has been mobilised.
I then use materials from anthropology, science and technology studies, and to a lesser
extent geography and postcolonial studies to complicate and in some cases question
the interpretative frames that are being applied. Thus, my hope is that this paper
is seen as a thought piece that deepens our thinking around HCI's efforts to look
"out there" by paying critical attention to what is going on "in here".},

technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability,
and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our
findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream
technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting
edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design

Emotionally-aware systems would have a rich context from which to make appropriate
decisions about how to interact with the user or adapt their system response. There
are two main problems with current system approaches for identifying emotions that
limit their applicability: they can be invasive and can require costly equipment.
Our solution is to determine user emotion by analyzing the rhythm of their typing
patterns on a standard keyboard. We conducted a field study where we collected participants'
keystrokes and their emotional states via self-reports. From this data, we extracted
keystroke features, and created classifiers for 15 emotional states. Our top results
include 2-level classifiers for confidence, hesitance, nervousness, relaxation, sadness,
and tiredness with accuracies ranging from 77 to 88%. In addition, we show promise
for anger and excitement, with accuracies of 84%.},

the event in an effort to deflate negative reactions. Drivers in the second group,
reappraisal-up, heard voice prompts that brought attention to the negative actions
of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers in a silent condition drove without hearing any
voice prompts. Participants in the reappraisal-down condition had better driving behavior

find nine personas in the data that tell us who the spectators are and why they spectate;
ii) we strive to understand how different stakeholders, like commentators, players,
crowds, and game designers, affect the spectator experience; and iii) we infer from
the spectators' expressions what makes the game entertaining to watch, forming a theory
of distinct types of information asymmetry that create suspense for the spectator.
One design implication derived from these findings is that, rather than presenting
as much information to the spectator as possible, it is more important for the stakeholders
to be able to decide how and when they uncover that information.},

installation decisions. Fortunately, home environments frequently offer a signal that
is unique to locations and objects within the home: electromagnetic noise. In this
work, we use the body as a receiving antenna and leverage this noise for gestural
interaction. We demonstrate that it is possible to robustly recognize touched locations
on an uninstrumented home wall using no specialized sensors. We conduct a series of
experiments to explore the capabilities that this new sensing modality may offer.
Specifically, we show robust classification of gestures such as the position of discrete
touches around light switches, the particular light switch being touched, which appliances
are touched, differentiation between hands, as well as continuous proximity of hand
to the switch, among others. We close by discussing opportunities, limitations, and

abstract = {Speakers often use hand gestures when talking about or describing physical objects.
Such gesture is particularly useful when the speaker is conveying distinctions of
shape that are difficult to describe verbally. We present data miming---an approach
to making sense of gestures as they are used to describe concrete physical objects.
We first observe participants as they use gestures to describe real-world objects
to another person. From these observations, we derive the data miming approach, which
is based on a voxel representation of the space traced by the speaker's hands over
the duration of the gesture. In a final proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate a prototype
implementation of matching the input voxel representation to select among a database
of known physical objects.},

intuitive and natural. Analysis of 912 video clips of gesture production from a user
study of 16 subjects communicating transitive actions (manipulation of objects with
or without external tools) indicated that 1) dynamic pantomimic gestures where imagined
tool/object is explicitly held are performed more intuitively and easily than gestures
where a body part is used to represent the tool/object or compared to static hand
poses and 2) gesturing while communicating the transitive action as how the user habitually
performs the action (pantomimic action) is perceived to be easier and more natural
than gesturing while communicating it as an instruction. These findings provide guidelines
for the characteristics of gestures and user mental models one must consciously be
concerned with when designing and implementing gesture vocabularies of touchless interaction.},

to drive computing systems into the future. However, as we move towards a world where
interaction is based on human body movements that are not well documented or studied,
we face a serious and a grave risk of creating technology and systems that may lead
to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD's). Designers need to be empowered with objective
data on the impact of multitouch interactions on the musculoskeletal system to make
informed choices in interaction design. In this paper we present an experiment that
documents kinematic (movement) and kinetic measures (EMG) when interacting with a
multitouch tablet. Results show that multitouch interaction can induce significant
stress that may lead to MSDs and care must be taken when designing multitouch interaction.},

an off-screen cursor feedback make the technique more usable and more compatible with
everyday desktop usage. We report on three controlled experiments conducted to refine

on their speed and direction. We also introduce Target Ghost, which allows users to
select a static proxy of the target, while leaving the motion uninterrupted. We found
a speed benefit for the Comet in a 1D selection task in comparison to other cursor

when Target Ghost was not available. We conclude with guidelines for design.},

cursor to the screen, potentially making it easier to find a 'lost' cursor. Six older
adult computer users and six younger computer users were asked to compare the touch
sensitive mouse with cursor centering with two alternative techniques for locating
the mouse cursor: manually shaking the mouse and using the Windows sonar facility.
The time taken to click on a target following a distractor task was recorded, and
results show that centering the mouse was the fastest to use, with a 35% improvement
over shaking the mouse. Five out of six older participants ranked the touch sensitive
mouse with cursor centering as the easiest to use.},

exhibit use is generally one-time-only, any interfaces created for these purposes
must be easily learnable, or visitors may not use the exhibit at all. To guide the
design of learnable mobile interfaces, we chose to employ the Consistency design principle.
Consistency was originally applied to desktop UIs, so we extended the definition to
cover three new categories of consistency relevant to ubiquitous computing: Within-Device
Consistency, Across-Device Consistency and Within-Context Consistency. We experimentally
contrasted designs created from these categories. The results show small differences
in learnability, but illustrate that even for one-off situations learnability may
not be as important as usability.},

abstract = {Providing good education is one of the major challenges for humanity. In many developing
regions in the world improving educational standards is seen as a central building
block for improving socio-economic situation of society. Based on our research in
Panama we report on how mobile phones can be used as educational tools. In contrast
to personal computers mobile phones are widely available and in Panama over 80% of
the children have access to phones. We report on four different studies building on
one another. We conducted surveys, focus groups, and group interviews with several
hundred teachers and pupils to assess opportunities, needs, and threads for using
phones in teaching and learning. Based on the feedback received we created a set of
use cases and finally evaluated these in a field study in a rural multigrade school
in Panama. Our findings suggest that current phones with multimedia capabilities provide
a valuable resource for teaching and learning across many subjects. In particular
recording of audio and video, programs for drawing, and taking photos were used in
very creative and constructive ways beyond the use cases envisioned by us and initial
skepticism of parents turned into support.},

how touch surface curvature affects targeting. We present a user study in which participants
acquired targets on surfaces of different curvature and at locations of different
slope. We find that surface convexity increases pointing accuracy, and in particular
reduces the offset between the input point perceived by users and the input point
sensed by the device. Concave surfaces, in contrast, are subject to larger error offsets.
This is likely caused by how concave surfaces hug the user's finger, thus resulting
in a larger contact area. The effect of slope on targeting, in contrast, is unexpected
at first sight. Some targets located downhill from the user's perspective are subject
to error offsets in the opposite direction from all others. This appears to be caused
by participants acquiring these targets using a different finger posture that lets
them monitor the position of their fingers more effectively.},

the mismatch between HCI research and interaction design practices. Then we present
vignettes from an observational study of commercial design practice to illustrate
the issues at hand. In part two, we discuss methodological and theoretical changes

how the social-technical milieu enabled individual capacities and collective action.
Using social theory about self-organizing, the research offers insight about features
of coordination within a setting of massive interaction.},

comes into play most crucially when we investigate how social media is saved or archived;
how it is reused; and whether it can be removed or deleted. We investigate these social
media ownership issues using a Mechanical Turk survey of Twitter users; the survey
uses open-ended questions and statements of belief about realistic Twitter-based scenarios
to give us a window onto current attitudes and beliefs. Our findings reveal that respondents
take a liberal attitude toward saving and storing the tweets that they encounter.
More caution is exercised with republishing the material, and still more with sharing
the material among friends and associates. Respondents approach removal of this type
of lightweight social media most cautiously. The material's provenance and the respondents'
relationship to the material (whether they are the author or subject) has considerable
bearing on what they feel they can do with it.},

five strategies with which Internet users navigate blocking: self-censorship, cultivating
technical savvy, reliance on social ties to relay blocked content, use of already
blocked sites for content production as a form of protection and practiced transparency.
We also discuss strategies that forum owners and blogging platform providers employ
to deal with and to avoid blocking. We conclude by advocating for more research that
acknowledges the complexity of the contexts in which all Internet users contribute

of these eye-movement data. Results indicated that readers were able to explicitly
direct attention to the most important information in the text and that this improved
performance on a subsequent test of memory for the meaning of text. We suggest readers
achieve this by satisficing reading through text until the rate of information gain
drops below threshold and then skipping to the next section of text. Further analyses
of gaze patterns for paragraphs and pages supported this explanation. Combining satisficing
with some form of scanning or sampling behaviour could explain patterns of reading
found on the Web. A greater understanding of the way that text is read on the Web
would assist many producers of online content.},

age on eye-movement behavior tend to indicate a propensity for slower viewing and
longer times spent examining information. This pattern is usually attributed to the
general physiological and cognitive slow-down associated with normal aging. In this
paper, however, across three different tasks based on computer and internet use (free-viewing,
visual search, and browser interaction), we show that among older adults (n=18, age
range: 70-93) computer experience appears to be a highly important factor in eye-movement
behavior. We argue that as a consequence of the experimental environment used in modern
eye-tracking studies, characteristics such as familiarity and experience with computers
should be taken into account before conclusions are drawn about the raw effects of
age.},

their task execution process. In our study we complemented the recording of the performance
with a gaze trail of the participant" eye movements, in order to elicit more verbalizations.
A comparison was made between the traditional retrospective think-aloud protocols
and the variant with eye movements. Contrary to our expectations, no differences were
found between the two conditions on numbers of problems, the ways these problems were
detected, and types of problems. Two possible explanations for this result are that
eye movements might be rather confronting and distracting for participants, and the
rather generic way of probing we used. The added value might be stronger when specific
questions are asked, based on the observed eye movements. Implications for usability

to help manage transportation with a minimal amount of attention. On days when families

the routine location, availability and intentions of other family members. Since most
families rarely document their routine activities, making that needed information
unavailable, coordination breakdowns are much more likely to occur. To address this
problem we demonstrate the feasibility of learning family routines using mobile phone
GPS. We describe how we (1) detect pick-ups and drop-offs; (2) predict which parent
will perform a future pick-up or drop-off; and (3) infer if a child will be left at
an activity. We discuss how these routine models give digital calendars, reminder
and location systems new capabilities to help prevent breakdowns, and improve family

increased session lengths by another 50%. StoryVisit usage peaked for families with
three year olds, showing that sustained distance interactions with very young children
are possible if communication technologies incorporate joint activities that engage
children and adults.},

abstract = {Video conferencing allows distance-separated family members to interact somewhat akin
to being together at the same place and time. Yet most video conferencing systems
are designed for phone-like calls between only two locations. Using such systems for
long interactions or social gatherings with multiple families is cumbersome, if not
impossible. For this reason, we wanted to explore how families would make use of a
video system that permitted sharing everyday life over extended periods of time between
multiple locations. We designed a media space called Family Portals that provides
shared video between three locations and deployed it within the homes of six families.
Results show that the media space increased feelings of connectedness and the focus
on a triad, in contrast to a dyad, caused new styles of interaction to emerge. Despite
this, families experienced new privacy challenges and non-adoption by some family
members, not previously seen in dyadic family media spaces.},

related to eye gaze, especially on SERPs; (ii) present a scalable approach to capture
cursor movements, and an analysis of search result examination behavior evident in
these large-scale cursor data; and (iii) describe two applications (estimating search
result relevance and distinguishing good from bad abandonment) that demonstrate the
value of capturing cursor data. Our findings help us better understand how searchers
use cursors on SERPs and can help design more effective search systems. Our scalable

search results and to search for credible Web pages. Conventional Web search engines
present only titles, snippets, and URLs for users, which give few clues to judge the
credibility of Web search results. Moreover, ranking algorithms of the conventional
Web search engines are often based on relevance and popularity of Web pages. Towards
credibility-oriented Web search, our proposed system provides users with the following
three functions: (1) calculation and visualization of several scores of Web search
results on the main credibility aspects, (2) prediction of user's credibility judgment
model through user's credibility feedback for Web search results, and (3) re-ranking
of Web search results based on user's predicted credibility model. Experimental results
suggest that our system enables users - in particular, users with knowledge about
search topics - to find credible Web pages from a list of Web search results more
efficiently than conventional Web search interfaces.},

this paper, we argue that the combination of moving fast and interacting with a digital

key to this is careful attention to the way in which movement is combined with digital
content. We study an interactive art experience in which a person runs whilst listening
to poetry. Based on this study and other HCI research, we present a framework for
mixing physical and interactive content, based on 3 dimensions, which describe ways
that a movement activity may itself create intense experiences, followed by a set
of tactics for combining intense movement and interactive content.},

that optional rewards caused players to play less in both games. In one game, this

We report on an empirical evaluation in which we compared the efficiency of pointing

using a real flexible Lumalive display. Results suggest that structural force distributions
in a flexible display affect the Index of Performance of both pointing and dragging
tasks, irrespective of hold, with rigid parts of the display yielding a 12% average
performance gain over flexible areas.},

twenty actions in five applications. We identified six most frequently used bend gesture
pairs out of 24 unique pairs. Results show users preferred bend gestures and bend
gesture pairs that were conceptually simpler, e.g., along one axis, and less physically
demanding. There was a strong agreement among participants to use the same three pairs
in applications: (1) side of display, up/down (2) top corner, up/down (3) bottom corner,
up/down. For actions with a strong directional cue, we found strong consensus on the
polarity of the bend gestures (e.g., navigating left is performed with an upwards
bend gesture, navigating right, downwards). This implies that bend gestures that take
directional cues into account are likely more natural to users.},

allowing new touch gestures to be performed using the index finger or thumb and detecting
how users grip the device as a mechanism for mode switching. We also discuss the hardware
and software implementation challenges in realizing our prototype, and showcase how
one can combine different grips (tripod, relaxed tripod, sketch, wrap) and gestures
(swipe and double tap) to enable new interaction techniques with the MTPen in a prototype
drawing application. One specific aim is the elimination of some of the comfort problems
associated with existing auxiliary controls on digital pens. Mechanical controls such
as barrel buttons and barrel scroll wheels work best in only a few specific hand grips
and pen rotations. Comparatively, our gestures can be successfully and comfortably
performed regardless of the rotation of the pen or how the user grips it, offering
greater flexibility in use. We describe a formal evaluation comparing MTPen gestures
against the use of a barrel button for mode switching. This study shows that both
swipe and double tap gestures are comparable in performance to commonly employed barrel
buttons without its disadvantages.},

manipulated at any desired position within the displayed volume data using a commonly
available mobile device such as the iPod touch. 2D image slices can be transferred
wirelessly to this small touch screen device, where a novel fast fat finger annotation

abstract = {Set construction is the process of selecting and positioning virtual geometric objects
to create a virtual environment used in a computer-animated film. Set construction
artists often have a clear mental image of the set composition, but find it tedious
to build their intended sets with current mouse and keyboard interfaces. We investigate
whether multitouch input can ease the process of set construction. Working with a
professional set construction artist at Pixar Animation Studios, we designed and developed
Eden, a fully functional multitouch set construction application. In this paper, we
describe our design process and how we balanced the advantages and disadvantages of
multitouch input to develop usable gestures for set construction. Based on our design
process and the user experiences of two set construction artists, we present a general
set of lessons we learned regarding the design of a multitouch interface.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the area of touch and display technologies have suggested to
combine multi-touch systems and stereoscopic visualization. Stereoscopic perception
requires each eye to see a slightly different perspective of the same scene, which
results in two distinct projections on the display. Thus, if the user wants to select
a 3D stereoscopic object in such a setup, the question arises where she would touch
the 2D surface to indicate the selection. A user may apply different strategies, for
instance touching the midpoint between the two projections, or touching one of them.In
this paper we analyze the relation between the 3D positions of stereoscopically rendered
objects and the on-surface touch points, where users touch the surface. We performed
an experiment in which we determined the positions of the users' touches for objects,
which were displayed with positive, negative or zero parallaxes. We found that users
tend to touch between the projections for the two eyes with an offset towards the
projection for the dominant eye. Our results give implications for the development
of future touch-enabled interfaces, which support 3D stereoscopic visualization.},

abstract = {Manipulating 3D objects on a tabletop is inherently problematic. Tabletops lack a
third degree of freedom and thus require novel solutions to support even the simplest
3D manipulations. Our solution is TZee - a passive tangible widget that enables natural
interactions with 3D objects by exploiting the lighting properties of diffuse illumination
(DI) multi-touch tabletops. TZee is assembled from stacked layers of acrylic glass
to extend the tabletop's infrared light slightly above the surface without supplemental
power. With TZee, users can intuitively scale, translate and rotate objects in all
three dimensions, and also perform more sophisticated gestures, like "slicing" a volumetric
object, that have not been possible with existing tabletop interaction schemes. TZee
is built with affordable and accessible materials, and one tabletop surface can easily
support multiple TZees. Moreover, since TZee is transparent, there are numerous possibilities
to augment interactions with feedback, helpful hints, or other visual enhancements.
We discuss several important design considerations and demonstrate the value of TZee
with several applications.},

abstract = {Large-scale, ground-level urban imagery has recently developed as an important element
of online mapping tools such as Google's Street View. Such imagery is extremely valuable
in a number of potential applications, ranging from augmented reality to 3D modeling,
and from urban planning to monitoring city infrastructure. While such imagery is already
available from many sources, including Street View and tourist photos on photo-sharing
sites, these collections have drawbacks related to high cost, incompleteness, and
accuracy. A potential solution is to leverage the community of photographers around
the world to collaboratively acquire large-scale image collections. This work explores
this approach through PhotoCity, an online game that trains its players to become
"experts" at taking photos at targeted locations and in great density, for the purposes
of creating 3D building models. To evaluate our approach, we ran a competition between
two universities that resulted in the submission of over 100,000 photos, many of which
were highly relevant for the 3D modeling task at hand. Although the number of players
was small, we found that this was compensated for by incentives that drove players
to become experts at photo collection, often capturing thousands of useful photos
each.},

conducted an extended field study across four field sites in India that are rich in
folk music tradition and activity. Through a process of interviews, participant observation,
focus group discussion, and content analysis with a varied group of stakeholders -
including folk musicians, listeners, retailers, and radio show producers - we found
that 1) there are a diverse set of motivations for performing and listening to folk
music, 2) new media technologies are helping folk musicians become more popular, while
reducing some streams of revenue, particularly for businesses engaged only in music
production and distribution, and 3) as expected, piracy is widely tolerated by musicians,
both out of apathy, and an interest in reaching new audiences with their message,
while increasing their own fame and associated patronage. Based on these findings,
we propose some implications for the design of an appropriate folk music sharing and
distribution service that addresses these various motivations of the musicians and
listeners.},

the same social features that can provide rapid, high-accuracy analysis are coupled
with the pitfalls of any social system. Through an experiment involving over 300 subjects,
we address how social information signals (social proof) affect quantitative judgments

to fewer errors over non-social settings and conversely, how biased signals lead to
more errors. We further reflect on how systematic bias nullifies certain collective
intelligence benefits, and we provide evidence of the formation of information cascades.

organizing work around a specific topic, or for explaining the perspective of a given

the perceived value of their virtual possessions, and the comparative similarities

Pivoting, that allows users to search for contextually related activities and find
a target piece of information (often not semantically related). A sample motivation
for contextual search would be, 'what was that website I was looking at when Yesterday
by The Beatles was last playing?' Our interaction technique is grounded in the cognitive
science literature, and is demonstrated in our system YouPivot. In addition, we present
a new personal annotation method, called TimeMarks, to further support contextual
recall and the pivoting process. In a pilot study, participants were quicker to identify
websites, and preferred using YouPivot, compared to current tools. YouPivot demonstrates
how principles of human memory can be applied to enhance the search of digital information.},

gestures, allowing users to simultaneously sketch multiple diffusion curves and also
to interactively edit and tune curve geometry and colors. Our experiments show that
this not only brings novel painting experience to users but also provides a practical
and effective tool for vector graphics design, useful for styles like silk painting,
Disney cartoon, art poster, and photo-realistic effects. Lastly, we conduct a user

Our data, which we could analyze more thoroughly than Fitts', are consistent with
a square-root function with a single adjustable constant. We suggest that the resource-allocation

with distractors (i.e., potential targets which are not the goal of the user) in a
controlled manner. To reduce variability, we add a single new factor to the paradigm,
the distractor density. We specify a distractors distribution, fully determined by
this factor together with those of Fitts' task, aimed at reducing bias toward a specific
technique. We also propose a preliminary extension of Fitts' law to take account of
the sensitivity to the density of distractors as well as of the task difficulty. In

abstract = {Fitts' law (1954) characterizes pointing speed-accuracy performance as throughput,
whose invariance to target distances (A) and sizes (W) is known. However, it is unknown
whether throughput and Fitts' law models in general are invariant to task dimensionality
(1-D vs. 2-D), whether univariate (SDx) or bivariate (SDx,y) endpoint deviation is
used, whether throughput is calculated using the mean-of-means approach or the slope-inverse
approach, or whether Guiard's (2009) Form - Scale experiment design is used instead
of fully crossed A-W factors. We empirically investigate the confluence of these issues,
finding that Fitts' law is largely invariant across 1-D and 2-D, provided that univariate
endpoint deviation (SDx) is used in both, but that for 2-D pointing data, bivariate
endpoint deviation (SDx,y) results in better Fitts' law models. Also, the mean-of-means
throughput calculation exhibits lower variance across subjects and dimensionalities
than the slope-inverse calculation. In light of these and other findings, we offer
recommendations for pointing evaluations, especially in 2-D. We also offer an evaluation
tool called Fitts Study to facilitate comparisons.},

how the intended use of a target affects its acquisition. We studied aiming to a target

complement Fitts' law's predictive model of pointing speed. However, their model was
based on one-dimensional (1-D) horizontal movement, while applications of such a model
require two dimensions (2-D). In this paper, the pointing error model is investigated
for 2-D pointing in a study of 21 participants performing a time-matching task on
the ISO 9241-9 ring-of-circles layout. Results show that the pointing error model
holds well in 2-D. If univariate endpoint deviation (SDx) is used, regressing on N=72
observed vs. predicted error rate points yields R2=.953. If bivariate endpoint deviation
(SDx,y) is used, regression yields R2=.936. For both univariate and bivariate models,
the magnitudes of observed and predicted error rates are comparable.},

However, these systems are difficult to work with and to prototype, because they require
a critical mass of participants to investigate social behavior. Service design is
an emerging research area that focuses on how customers co-produce the services that
they use, and thus it appears to be a great domain to apply this new material. To
investigate this relationship, we developed Tiramisu, a transit information system
where commuters share GPS traces and submit problem reports. Tiramisu processes incoming
traces and generates real-time arrival time predictions for buses. We conducted a
field trial with 28 participants. In this paper we report on the results and reflect
on the use of field trials to evaluate crowd-sourcing prototypes and on how crowd
sourcing can generate co-production between citizens and public services.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore shared collocated interactions with mobile phones. We introduce
a phone-based application that allows a small group of collocated people to share
photos using the metaphor of passing paper photos around. The prototype encourages
people to share their devices and use them interchangeably while discussing photos
face-to-face. The prototype supports ad-hoc photo sharing in different contexts by
taking into account the spatial arrangement of users around a table, measured with
sensors embedded in their mobile phones. Our evaluations show that people are willing
to share and connect their mobile phones to engage in collaborative interactions.
Participants were able to easily share their collections of photos using our proposed
interaction techniques.},

can be assembled in minutes, is timely, has a high degree of ecological validity,

abstract = {The study of creativity has received significant attention over the past century,
with a recent increase in interest in collaborative, distributed creativity. We posit
that creativity in distributed groups is fostered by software interfaces that specifically
enable socio-emotional or affective communication. However, previous work on creativity
and affect has primarily focused on the individual, while group creativity research
has concentrated more on cognition rather than affect. In this paper we propose a
new model for creativity in distributed groups, based on the theory of groups as complex
systems, that includes affect as well as cognition and that explicitly calls out the
interface between individuals as a key parameter of the model. We describe the model,
the four stages of collaborative creativity and the causal dynamics in each stage,
and demonstrate how affect and interface can facilitate the generation, selection,
and amplification of ideas in the various stages of collaborative creativity. We then
validate our model with data from three field sites. The data was collected from longitudinal
studies of two distributed groups involved in producing creative products--astrophysicists
studying supernovae and the expansion rate of the universe and children creating multimedia
programming projects online-"-and interviews with staff in a multinational engineering
company.},

more users join the Mini-Grid. However, the invisible nature of such an infrastructure
hinders adoption, as it is difficult for users to participate in an infrastructure
they are not aware of. This paper introduces GridOrbit, a system designed to increase
user awareness, fostering contributions to this infrastructure. We designed GridOrbit
using a participatory design process with biologists, and subsequently deployed it
for use in a biology laboratory. Our results indicate that the number of contributors
to the Mini-Grid increased with the use of awareness technologies. In addition, our
analysis presents their motives and behaviors. Finally, a characterization of user
interaction with GridOrbit emerged, which enabled us to understand how awareness systems
can be better designed. We see GridOrbit as an example of a broader class of technologies
designed to create "Infrastructure Awareness" as a means to increase the contributions
to technological infrastructures.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe our research on how to design for perceptive activity in
artifacts in order for perceptual crossing between subject and artifact to happen.
We base our research on the phenomenology of perception [19] and on ecological psychology
[10]. Perceptual crossing is believed to be essential to share perception and thereby
to feel involved in the situation [5,15]. We propose a theoretical model in which
perceptive connections between user, artifact and event are presented. We designed
an artifact to function as physical hypotheses [9] and show the design relevance of
the model. In an experiment we investigate how the user's feeling of involvement is
influenced in relation to differentiations of the proposed theoretical model. The
results of our experiment show that indeed perceptual crossing between user and artifact
influences the user's feeling of involvement with the artifact in their common space.
We conclude with describing several design notions important for designing for perceptive
activity in artifacts.},

a methodological challenge: how do we study re-reading in the context of stories that

this. Using this approach, we have determined that readers, surprisingly, do not want
to experience endless variation when rereading interactive stories. Instead, they
are looking for some form of closure, either in terms of "understanding the story",
reaching the "best ending" for the characters in the story, or finding the "most interesting"
version of the story. This has implications for the design/authoring of interactive
stories and interactive art and entertainment.},

abstract = {Fire emergency responders rely on team coordination to survive and succeed in high-stress
environments, but traditional education does not directly teach these essential skills.
Prior simulations seek the highest possible fidelity, employing resources to capture
concrete characteristics of operating environments. We take a different tack, hypothesizing
that a zero-fidelity approach, focusing on human-centered aspects of work practice,
will improve team coordination learning. Such an approach promotes simulation focus
by developing an alternative environment that stimulates participants to engage in
distributed cognition. The costs of simulation development are reduced.To supplement
preparation for burn training exercises, 28 fire emergency response students played
the Teaching Team Coordination game (T2eC), a zero-fidelity simulation of the distributed
cognition of fire emergency response work practice. To test our hypothesis, we develop
quantitative evaluation methods for impact on team coordination learning through measures
of communication efficiency and cooperative activity. Results show that participants
improve cooperation, become more efficient communicators, differentiate team roles
through communication, and leverage multiple communication modalities. Given the context
of the study amidst the educational process, qualitative data from the students and
their expert instructor supports the ecological validity of the contribution of the
T2eC zero-fidelity simulation to fire emergency response education.},

been many attempts to address the issue of coordinating schedules, but each of these
attempts runs into an issue of rigidity: in order to negotiate an event, a specific
time must be designated in advance. This model is inherently poor at accommodating
life's unpredictability. Kairoscope looks at time from a human perspective, focusing
on time as made up of a series of events, rather than simply a series of events in
time. By removing our reliance on a fixed time system, events are coordinated socially
and on the fly, without worrying about precision. This paper explores the creation
of Kairoscope, rooted in ideas of time perception and aiming to reduce time-related
stress, optimize time usage, and increase social interaction. The result is a socially-coordinated,
constantly adapting, and highly malleable guide through time.},

to function as innovative educational tools. However, there is very little evidence
of games fulfilling that potential. Indeed, the process of merging the disparate goals
of education and games design appears problematic, and there are currently no practical
guidelines for how to do so in a coherent manner. In this paper, we describe the successful,
empirically validated teaching methods developed by behavioural psychologists and
point out how they are uniquely suited to take advantage of the benefits that games
offer to education. We conclude by proposing some practical steps for designing educational
games, based on the techniques of Applied Behaviour Analysis. It is intended that
this paper can both focus educational games designers on the features of games that
are genuinely useful for education, and also introduce a successful form of teaching
that this audience may not yet be familiar with.},

In this paper, we define Kineticons - an iconographic scheme based on motion. By motion,
we mean geometric manipulations applied to a graphical element over time (e.g., scale,
rotation, deformation). In contrast to static graphical icons and icons with animated
graphics, kineticons do not alter the visual content or "pixel-space" of an element.
Although kineticons are not new - indeed, they are seen in several popular systems
- we formalize their scope and utility. One powerful quality is their ability to be
applied to GUI elements of varying size and shape from a something as small as a close
button, to something as large as dialog box or even the entire desktop. This allows
a suite of system-wide kinetic behaviors to be reused for a variety of uses. Part
of our contribution is an initial kineticon vocabulary, which we evaluated in a 200
participant study. We conclude with discussion of our results and design recommendations.},

other techniques, but we saw technique differences depending on the type of visual

is rotating, the device is capable of providing the sensation of detents or bumps,
changes in stiffness, and abrupt stops using only power that is harvested during interaction.
We describe the device in detail, demonstrate an initial 'TV remote control' application,
and end with a discussion of our experiences developing the prototype and application.
To the best of our knowledge, InGen is the first self-powered device, which also provides
haptic feedback during operation. More broadly, this work demonstrates a new class

abstract = {While a large body of research on image-based authentication has focused on memorability,
comparatively less attention has been paid to the new security challenges these schemes
may introduce. Because images can convey more information than text, image-based authentication
may be more vulnerable to educated guess attacks than passwords. In this paper, we
evaluate the resilience of a recognition-based graphical authentication scheme using
distorted images against two types of educated guess attacks through two user studies.The
first study, consisting of 30 participants, investigates whether distortion prevents
educated guess attacks primarily based on information about individual users. The
second study, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, investigates whether distortion mitigates
the risk of educated guess attacks based on collective information about users. Our
results show that authentication images without distortion are vulnerable to educated
guess attacks, especially when information about the target is known, and that distortion
makes authentication images more resilient against educated guess attacks.},

(allow or deny) for the same access. We present the results of a user study that demonstrates
the significant impact of conflict-resolution method on policy-authoring usability.
In our study of 54 participants, varying the conflict-resolution method yielded statistically
significant differences in accuracy in five of the six tasks we tested, including
differences in accuracy rates of up to 78%. Our results suggest that a conflict-resolution
method favoring rules of smaller scope over rules of larger scope is more usable than
the Microsoft Windows operating system's method of favoring deny rules over allow
rules. Perhaps more importantly, our results demonstrate that even seemingly small
changes to a system's semantics can fundamentally affect the system's usability in
ways that are beyond the power of user interfaces to correct.},

abstract = {Phishers are fraudsters that mimic legitimate websites to steal user's credenfitial
information and exploit that information for identity theft and other criminal activities.
Various anti-phishing techniques attempt to mitigate such attacks. Domain highlighting
is one such approach recently incorporated by several popular web browsers. The idea
is simple: the domain name of an address is highlighted in the address bar, so that
users can inspect it to determine a web site's legitimacy. Our research asks a basic
question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants
16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had
to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy
by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically
to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms
of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was
somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others. We conclude
that domain highlighting, while providing some benefit, cannot be relied upon as the
sole method to prevent phishing attacks.},

abstract = {As users store and share more digital content at home, access control becomes increasingly
important. One promising approach for helping non-expert users create accurate access
policies is reactive policy creation, in which users can update their policy dynamically
in response to access requests that would not otherwise succeed. An earlier study
suggested reactive policy creation might be a good fit for file access control at
home. To test this, we conducted an experience-sampling study in which participants
used a simulated reactive access-control system for a week. Our results bolster the
case for reactive policy creation as one mode by which home users specify access-control
policy. We found both quantitative and qualitative evidence of dynamic, situational
policies that are hard to implement using traditional models but that reactive policy
creation can facilitate. While we found some clear disadvantages to the reactive model,
they do not seem insurmountable.},

home automation becomes amenable to broader adoption. These barriers are high cost
of ownership, inflexibility, poor manageability, and difficulty achieving security.
Our findings also provide several directions for further research, which include eliminating
the need for structural changes for installing home automation, providing users with
simple security primitives that they can confidently configure, and enabling composition

Watch, an iPhone application and website that allow volunteers to report information

local officials and private groups involved in water monitoring, we conducted a series
of contextual inquiries to uncover what data they wanted, what data they could immediately
use, and how to most effectively deliver that data to them. We iteratively developed
the Creek Watch application and website based on our findings and conducted evaluations
of it with both contributors and consumers of water data, including scientists at
the city water resources department. Our study reveals that the data collected is
indeed useful for their existing practices and is already in use in water and trash
management programs. Our results suggest the application of HCI methods to design
the data for the end users is just as important as their use in designing the user
interface.},

two novel and intuitive interaction techniques, deep shooting and deep posting, for
pulling and pushing work states, respectively, using a mobile phone camera. In addition,
Deep Shot provides a concise API for developers to leverage its services and make
their application states migratable. We demonstrated that Deep Shot can be used to
support a range of everyday tasks migrating across devices. An evaluation consisting

while interacting with an audio menu. Results showed that spatial audio techniques
were preferred when cognitive load was kept low, while a baseline technique using
an interruptible single audio stream was significantly less preferred. Conversely,
when cognitive load was increased the preferences reversed. Thus, given an appropriate

search was disliked and led to worse performance. And auto-completion was generally

leveraging existing designs to produce new pages is often difficult. This paper introduces
the Bricolage algorithm for transferring design and content between Web pages. Bricolage
employs a novel, structured-prediction technique that learns to create coherent mappings
between pages by training on human-generated exemplars. The produced mappings are
then used to automatically transfer the content from one page into the style and layout
of another. We show that Bricolage can learn to accurately reproduce human page mappings,
and that it provides a general, efficient, and automatic technique for retargeting
content between a variety of real Web pages.},

help programmers maintain con-text, reduce the cost of Web page re-retrieval, and
enhance understanding when code is shared. This note introduces HyperSource, an IDE
augmentation that associates browsing histories with source code edits. HyperSource
comprises a browser extension that logs visited pages; an IDE that tracks user activity
and maps pages to code edits; a source document model that tracks visited pages at
a character level; and a user interface that enables interaction with these histories.
We discuss relevance heuristics and privacy issues inherent in this approach. Informal
log analyses and user feedback suggest that our annotation model is promising for
code editing and might also apply to other document authoring tasks after refinement.},

of this approach are respondents accidentally agreeing with negative items (mistakes)

Scale (SUS) and an all positively worded version were administered in two experiments
(n=161 and n=213) across eleven websites. There was no evidence for differences in
the response biases between the different versions. A review of 27 SUS datasets found
3 (11%) were miscoded by researchers and 21 out of 158 questionnaires (13%) contained
mistakes from users.We found no evidence that the purported advantages of including
negative and positive items in usability questionnaires outweigh the disadvantages
of mistakes and miscoding. It is recommended that researchers using the standard SUS
verify the proper coding of scores and include procedural steps to ensure error-free
completion of the SUS by users.Researchers can use the all positive version with confidence
because respondents are less likely to make mistakes when responding, researchers
are less likely to make errors in coding, and the scores will be similar to the standard
SUS.},

studies using a three-dimensional virtual usability testing laboratory built using

two other commonly used synchronous usability test methods: the traditional lab approach

with 48 participants in total, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators. The
test participants completed 5 tasks on a simulated e-commerce website. The three methodologies
were compared with respect to the following dependent variables: the time taken to
complete the tasks; the usability defects identified; the severity of these usability
defects; and the subjective ratings from NASA-TLX, presence and post-test subjective
questionnaires. The three methodologies agreed closely in terms of the total number
defects identified, number of high severity defects identified and the time taken
to complete the tasks. However, there was a significant difference in the workload
experienced by the test participants and facilitators, with the traditional lab condition
imposing the least and the virtual lab and the WebEx conditions imposing similar levels.
It was also found that the test participants experienced greater involvement and a
more immersive experience in the virtual world condition than the WebEx condition.
These ratings were not significantly different from those in the traditional lab condition.
The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the
virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach
as an alternative to the conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing.},

However, adoption of these tools by entire groups is a major problem. One reason for
the adoption problem is a lack of methods for considering collaborative groups in
technology design. Even when designing collaboration tools, designers often employ
methods that focus on individuals. This leads to tools that are not well targeted
at the groups who will use them. To solve this problem, we propose the notion of collaboration
personas, which are empirically derived descriptions of hypothetical groups, including
details that inform the design of collaboration tools. Collaboration personas differ
from individual personas in having (1) multiple, inter-related individuals playing
specific roles; (2) a focus on collective goals and elaboration of individual goals
that affect the collective goal; and (3) new attributes that characterize collaborative
aspects of the group's work. We contrast collaboration personas with other design
approaches and provide examples of how they can be used to design new collaborative
tools that better meet the needs of typical groups.},

reviews for the benefit of others. In this paper we examine the relative strengths
and weaknesses of each technique, whether these techniques are compatible, and how
community feedback can be combined with heuristic-based evaluations. In order to do
this we conduct a large-scale comparison of the ratings of heuristic and community
based tools, and explore novel methods for abstracting key information from user comments,
which could be used to add context and nuance to heuristic based ratings. We find
that heuristic and community based ratings are highly complementary, and can be combined
to potentially guide users to make more informed decisions.},

abstract = {When users wish to establish wireless radio communication between/among their devices,
the channel has to be bootstrapped first. The process of setting up a secure communication
channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred to as "Secure Device
Pairing". The focus of prior research on this topic has mostly been limited to "personal
pairing" scenarios, whereby a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,
we instead consider "social pairing" scenarios, whereby two different users establish
pairing between their respective devices. We present a comprehensive study to identify
methods suitable for social pairing, and comparatively evaluate the usability and
security of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for users, in
terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our work provides insights
on the applicability and usability of methods for emerging social pairing scenarios,
a topic largely ignored so far.},

in everyday situations, users base their security decisions on a mix of prior experiences.
When approaching security and interaction design from an experience approach, tools
that help bring out such relevant experiences for design are needed. This paper reports
on how Prompted exploration workshops and Acting out security were developed to target
such experiences when iteratively designing a mobile digital signature solution in
a participatory design process. We discuss how these tools helped the design process
and illustrate how the tangibility of such tools matters. We further demonstrate how
the approach grants access to non-trivial insights into people's security experience.
We point out how the specific context is essential for exploring the space between
experience and expectations, and we illustrate how people activate their collections
of security experiences rather than deploying one security strategy in all situations.},

prior game experience did not bias the experiment. Our results indicate that although
participants preferred playing in 3D stereo for the games we tested, it does not provide
any significant advantage in overall user performance. In addition, users' learning

players with different skill levels to have a competitive and engaging experience.
Although several mechanisms for accommodating different skill levels have been proposed,
traditional approaches can be too obvious and can change the nature of the game. For
games involving aiming, we propose the use of target assistance techniques (such as
area cursors, target gravity, and sticky targets) to accommodate skill imbalances.
We compared three techniques in a study, and found that area cursors and target gravity
significantly reduced score differential in a shooting-gallery game. Further, less
skilled players reported having more fun when the techniques helped them be more competitive,
and even after they learned assistance was given, felt that this form of balancing
was good for group gameplay. Our results show that target assistance techniques can
make target-based games more competitive for shared play.},

game-related data. In this paper we present how a visual game analytic tool can be
developed to analyze player gameplay behavior. Our tool, Data Cracker, was built for
monitoring gameplay in Dead Space 2, the latest game in the Dead Space franchise.
We use Data Cracker as a case study to inform a larger discussion of designing a visual
game analytic tool while working with a game team. Our design approach focuses on
increasing the data literacy of a game team. This means getting an entire team interested
and involved with game analytics. We found that building our tool during the early
game development cycle, creating multiple early visual prototypes and branding the
tool to the Dead Space team caused more team members to become interested in our tool.
Increasing interest in analytics is also a means, we argue, for changing the common
occurrence within the game industry to disband teams after a game is released. Instead,
we promote the creation of "live" teams which stay attached to a game long after it
is release in order to continue the analysis process. Additionally, we discuss the
barriers one might face when developing game analytic tools, such as prejudice against
analytics or the technical issues involved when collecting large data sets. All of
these examples are presented as insights we gained while coupling analytic tool design
to game development.},

discarded as trash, there are predictable negative impacts on the environment and

with eco-friendly decomposable materials to more radical critiques of current practices
surrounding capitalism and consumerism. Complementary to theses efforts, this paper
presents an accessible reuse framework that encourages creativity while maintaining
personal ownership of e-waste. Through a series of online surveys of existing personal
e-waste stockpiling behaviors combined with observational studies of existing reuse
practices, we developed a design reuse vocabulary: materials, shapes, and operations
to enable wide ranging and creative reuse of obsolete electronics by everyday people.
We operationalized this vocabulary and evaluated its legibility and usefulness. As
a result, we derived a novel reuse composition framework: reuse as-is, remake, and
remanufacture designed to be accessible and to have broader impact in encouraging
creative reuse across a wide range of e-waste types beyond those specifically used
in our study. We believe these frameworks will be a catalyst for the creative reuse
of e-waste.},

typing patterns that emerge when expert users of physical keyboards touch-type on
a flat surface. Our aim is to inform future designs of touch screen keyboards, with
the ultimate goal of supporting touch-typing with limited tactile feedback. To study
the issues inherent to flat-glass typing, we asked 20 expert typists to enter text
under three conditions: (1) with no visual keyboard and no feedback on input errors,
then (2) with and (3) without a visual keyboard, but with some feedback. We analyzed
touch contact points and hand contours, looking at attributes such as natural finger
positioning, the spread of hits among individual keys, and the pattern of non-finger

abstract = {This paper introduces a text entry application for users with physical disabilities
who cannot utilize a manual keyboard. The system allows the user to enter text hands-free,
with the help of "Non-verbal Vocal Input" (e.g., humming or whistling). To keep the
number of input sounds small, an ambiguous keyboard is used. As the user makes a sequence
of sounds, each representing a subset of the alphabet, the program searches for matches
in a dictionary. As a model for the system, the scanning-based application QANTI was
redesigned and adapted to accept the alternative input signals. The usability of the
software was investigated in an international longitudinal study done at locations
in the Czech Republic, Germany, and the United States. Eight test users were recruited
from the target community. The users differed in the level of speech impairment. Three
users did not complete the study due to the severity of their impairment. By the end
of the experiment, the users were able to enter text at rates between 10 and 15 characters
per minute.},

alphabet, AirStroke takes advantage of the richer input capabilities of two-handed
freehand gestures by providing combined mode selection and character entry with one
hand, as well as word completion with the other hand. A longitudinal study suggests
that AirStroke has competitive speed and accuracy to unistroke methods based on stylus

employ a procedure whereby users are prompted with natural language phrases which
they are instructed to enter as stimuli. For experimental validity, it is desirable
to control the stimuli and present text that is representative of a target task, domain
or language. MacKenzie and Soukoreff (2001) manually selected a set of 500 phrases
for text entry experiments. To demonstrate representativeness, they correlated the
distribution of single letters in their phrase set to a relatively small (by current
standards) corpus of English prior to 1966, which may not reflect the style of text
input today. In this paper, we ground the notion of representativeness in terms of
information theory and propose a procedure for sampling representative phrases from
any large corpus so that researchers can curate their own stimuli. We then describe
the characteristics of phrase sets we generated using the procedure for email and
social media (Facebook and Twitter). The phrase sets and code for the procedure are
publicly available for download.},

interactions are supported by graphics, sounds or crude clicks, have a tactile sameness
and gaps in usability. We use a Large Area Tactile Pattern Display (LATPaD) to examine
design possibilities and outcomes when touch interactions are enhanced with variable
surface friction. In a series of four studies, we first confirm that variable friction
gives significant performance advantages in low-level targeting activities. We then
explore the design space of variable friction interface controls and assess user reactions.
Most importantly, we demonstrate that variable friction can have a positive impact
on the enjoyment, engagement and sense of realism experienced by users of touch interfaces.},

distance or increase target width in either control or display space. This new technique
operates instead in the tactile domain by taking advantage of the ability to alter
a touchpad's coefficient of friction by means of a squeeze film effect. We report
on three experiments comparing Surfpad to the Semantic Pointing technique and constant
control-display gain with and without distractor targets. Our results clearly show
the limits of traditional target-aware control-display gain adaptation in the latter
case, and the benefits of our tactile approach in both cases. Surfpad leads to a performance
improvement close to 9% compared to unassisted pointing at small targets with no distractor.
It is also robust to high distractor densities, keeping an average performance improvement
of nearly 10% while Semantic Pointing can degrade up to 100%. Our results also suggest
the performance improvement is caused by tactile information feedback rather than
mechanical causes, and that the feedback is more effective when friction is increased
on targets using a simple step function.},

that users acquire targets with the center of the contact area between finger and
device. Findings from our previous work indicate, however, that such devices are subject
to systematic error offsets. This suggests that the underlying assumption is most
likely wrong. In this paper, we therefore revisit this assumption. In a series of
three user studies, we find evidence that the features that users align with the target
are visual features. These features are located on the top of the user's fingers,
not at the bottom, as assumed by traditional devices. We present the projected center
model, under which error offsets drop to 1.6mm, compared to 4mm for the traditional
model. This suggests that the new model is indeed a good approximation of how users
conceptualize touch input. The primary contribution of this paper is to help understand
touch-one of the key input technologies in human-computer interaction. At the same
time, our findings inform the design of future touch input technology. They explain
the inaccuracy of traditional touch devices as a -Sparallax- artifact between user
control based on the top of the finger and sensing based on the bottom side of the
finger. We conclude that certain camera-based sensing technologies can inherently
be more accurate than contact area-based sensing.},

for multi-touch, and also the type of input most appropriate for each of these regions.
Second, guided by the results from our study, we explore the design space of multi-touch-integrated
desktop experiences. A set of new interaction techniques are coherently integrated
into a desktop prototype, called Magic Desk, demonstrating potential uses for multi-touch

instead turn to spreadsheets, which lend themselves poorly to schemas requiring multiple

spreadsheets and tailor-made relational database applications by extending the spreadsheet
paradigm to let the user establish relationships between rows in related worksheets
as well as view and navigate the hierarchical cell structure that arises as a result.

in real-time using a particle filter; this results in an efficient and robust pose
estimator which also gives appropriate uncertainty estimates. We show empirically
that tracking the full pose of the finger results in greater accuracy in pointing
tasks with small targets than competitive techniques. Our model can detect and cope
with different finger sizes and the use of either fingers or thumbs, bringing a significant
potential for improvement in one-handed interaction with touch devices. In addition
to the gain in accuracy we also give examples of how this technique could open up

the selection of small icons, by detecting the finger proximity above the display

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer
systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary
to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring
passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the
relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting
passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response
to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength,
user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize
the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number
of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We
correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations
for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening
users.},

mechanism using tagging. Marasim is aimed at achieving the security of random images
with the memorability of personal images. Our scheme relies on the human ability to
remember a personal image and later recognize the alternate visual representations
(images) of the concepts occurred in the image. These concepts are retrieved from
the tags assigned to the image. We illustrate how a Jigsaw based approach helps to
create a portfolio of system-chosen random images to be used for authentication. The
paper describes the complete design of Marasim along with the empirical studies of
Marasim that provide evidences of increased memorability. Results show that 93% of
all participants succeeded in the authentication tests using Marasim after three months
while 71% succeeded in authentication tests using Marasim after nine months. Our findings
indicate that Marasim has potential applications, especially where text input is hard
(e.g., PDAs or ATMs), or in situations where passwords are infrequently used (e.g.,
web site passwords).},

abstract = {Knowledge-based authentication systems generally rely upon users' explicit recollection
of passwords, facts, or personal preferences. These systems impose a cognitive burden
that often results in forgotten secrets or secrets with poor entropy. We propose an
authentication system that instead draws on implicit memory - that is, the unconscious
encoding and usage of information. In such a system, a user is initially presented
with images of common objects in a casual familiarization task. When the user later
authenticates, she is asked to perform a task involving a set of degraded images,
some of which are based upon the images in the familiarization task. The prior exposure
to those images influences the user's responses in the task, thereby eliciting authentication
information. We ran a user study to investigate the plausibility of our system design.
Our results suggest that implicit memory has potential as a basis for low-cognitive-overhead,
high-stability, knowledge-based authentication.},

perspective on anthropomorphism, with a focus on manifest interaction. Drawing upon
a field study of hunters' use of a GPS dog tracking-device, we discuss how interaction
between dogs and humans is affected when new technology is introduced. The GPS data
is situated and interpreted by the dog handler, and supports the hunter's work of
dealing with the dogs' intentions. This opens up for new forms of interactions with
the dog. When studying and designing for interaction between humans and animals we
should move beyond merely looking at dyadic relationships, and also consider the social
organization of the interaction.},

abstract = {Pico projectors attached to mobile phones allow users to view phone content using
a large display. However, to provide input to projector phones, users have to look
at the device, diverting their attention from the projected image. Additionally, other
collocated users have no way of interacting with the device.We present ShadowPuppets,
a system that supports collocated interaction with mobile projector phones. ShadowPuppets
allows users to cast hand shadows as input to mobile projector phones. Most people
understand how to cast hand shadows, which provide an easy input modality. Additionally,
they implicitly support collocated usage, as nearby users can cast shadows as input
and one user can see and understand another user's hand shadows.We describe the results
of three user studies. The first study examines what hand shadows users expect will
cause various effects. The second study looks at how users perceive hand shadows,
examining what effects they think various hand shadows will cause. Finally, we present
qualitative results from a study with our functional prototype and discuss design
implications for systems using shadows as input. Our findings suggest that shadow
input can provide a natural and intuitive way of interacting with projected interfaces
and can support collocated collaboration.},

devices be able to distinguish between motion intended for mobile interaction and

as an input delimiter for mobile motion-based interaction. The DoubleFlip gesture
is distinct from regular motion of a mobile device. Based on a collection of 2,100
hours of motion data captured from 99 users, we found that our DoubleFlip recognizer
is extremely resistant to false positive conditions, while still achieving a high
recognition rate. Since DoubleFlip is easy to perform and unlikely to be accidentally
invoked, it provides an always-active input event for mobile interaction.},

back-of-device taps to control a dialled-up, telephone-network-based voice service.
We show how these audio gestures might be recognised over a standard telephone connection,
via users' existing low-end devices. Further, in a longitudinal deployment, the techniques
were made available on a live voice service used by rural Indian farmers. Data from
the study illustrates the desire by users to adopt the approach and its potential

compared the response time of the keyboard method across 240 trials when items were

that hierarchical, category-based keyboard commands do not provide a clear advantage

of vowel-like sounds to radial directions as one potential method to enable sonification
of such information. We conducted a longitudinal study with five sighted and two blind

by stepping along a rotating floor plate. For the first time, integrating simple auditory
and biomechanical cues for turning in place evoked convincing circular vection. In
an auditory baseline condition, participants experienced only spatialized auditory
cues. In a purely biomechanical condition, seated participants stepped along sideways
on a rotating plate while listening to mono masking sounds. Scores of the bi-modal
condition (binaural+biomechanical cues) exceeded the sum of both single cue conditions,

created advertisements individually and then met with a partner. In the Share Multiple
condition, participants designed and shared three ads. In the Share Best condition,
participants designed three ads and selected one to share. In the Share One condition,
participants designed and shared one ad. Sharing multiple designs improved outcome,
exploration, sharing, and group rapport. These participants integrated more of their
partner's ideas into their own subsequent designs, explored a more divergent set of
ideas, and provided more productive critiques of their partner's designs. Furthermore,
their ads were rated more highly and garnered a higher click-through rate when hosted
online.},

body view. Although previous research has often failed to illustrate the advantages
of showing remote participants' upper body view, our study showed that task performance
was significantly higher in conditions with upper body view. Furthermore, participants
with upper body view tended to take a step away from their remote partners to effectively
glance at them while taking a comparable perspective of the tabletop objects. Detailed
analysis of the video recordings revealed that upper body view was effective for fluid
tabletop collaboration because it helped achieve joint perspective and helped estimate
the timing and rough location of subsequent tabletop activity.},

the effects of the rate with which potential answerers were contacted (trading off
time-to-answer against interruption cost) and community size (varying total number
of members). We found important differences in subjective and objective measures of

aftermath of a fundamental redesign, where site-based communication mechanisms no

and resettled on other sites provides empirical data to support recent research on
the life cycle of online communities. The results suggest that many of the same processes
that help social Q&amp;A sites generate content and motivate participation can work to
dismantle an established community if communications between members are even temporarily
disrupted. Modeling a redesign as an attack on a community can help future designers
anticipate alternative paths of communication and information flows.},

characterizes a possible trajectory for NGOs and women to engage with each other and
among themselves potentially augmented by technology to help women escape from poverty.
The fieldwork components in this study took place over 15 weeks in three phases, with
a total of 47 NGO staff members and 35 socio-economically challenged women in rural
and urban India. Interviews and co-design sessions with seven proof-of-concept prototypes
showed that women appeared to belong to five distinct stages of growth in striving
towards independence. We report the technology design lessons from our co-design sessions
to illustrate how user readiness, relationship building at the community and family
levels, and integration with state, national and international level programs, should
be taken into account in the broader context of intervention design.},

manage. Many information scraps seem to exist that don't make their way into these
tools, instead being relegated to sticky notes, text files, and other makeshift storage,
or simply being lost. In an effort to understand the role of these information scraps,
the underlying needs they reflect, and the way PIM tools must be modified to support
those needs, we created List-it, a micronote tool for quick and simple capture of
information scraps.In this article, we analyze the notes and interaction logs of 420
volunteer users of List-it over a two-year period of study (August 2008-August 2010).
We contextualize our analysis with results of two surveys and an e-mail interview
we conducted in October 2009. We find that people are drawn to List-it by the ease
and speed of note capture and by the ability to record scraps with arbitrary content
that blends or completely escapes the types and roles imposed by our rigid PIM tools.
Notes are taken to serve a variety of needs -- reminding, reference, journaling/activity
logging, brainstorming, and to indefinitely archive information of sentimental or
personal value. Finally, while people differ considerably in the ways they keep information,
our findings suggest such differences can be described as a combination of four distinct
strategies, enriching the Filer/Piler distinction identified for classic document
management.},

assessing the acceptability of the game and intervention with 216 practicing therapists.
Findings are presented within the context of a framework for the design and evaluation

on a clinical pilot of the system with ten users in public mental health clinics.
As well as indicating that the mobile diary tool can increase client adherence to
therapeutic activities, the study yields insight into the factors influencing the
success of the design and informs the design of other systems to be used as adjuncts

is a pressing need for engaging HCI research with children at the socio-economic margins.
Drawing from design studio culture and art therapy literature, we explore wearable
computing as a creative and tangible medium (similar to markers, paints, clays, etc.)
for motivating 'at-risk' children in hands-on making and expressive instantiation
of ideas. Working with a local outreach organization for 'at-risk' middle school girls,
we conducted five weekly workshops during which participants ideated, designed and
implemented personal wearable computing projects. These sessions inspired participants
(age 10-12) who tend to be uninterested and uncooperative in educational activities
to complete interactive projects and engage with workshop volunteers as mentors and
peers. We present the challenges, merits and outcomes of our approach, proposing wearable
computing as a healing outlet and a mentoring strategy for at-risk children.},

translate that passion into learning about computing. Part of the problem is that
they do not identify with computing as a social norm within their peer group. This
disidentification with computing can negatively impact academic performance and limit
opportunities for upward mobility. We developed a job training program called Glitch
Game Testers in which young African American men are trained to 'Sbreak open the black
box' of their game consoles to learn about computing. Perceptions of peers' technical
competency were measured before and after the summer 2010 program. Results showed
that participants were more likely to view their peers as technical resources and
their overall access to technical resources increased. Broader implications for motivating
technology adoption in HCI are discussed.},

A first study shows that Tangible Bots are usable for fine-grained manipulation (e.g.,
rotating tangibles to a particular orientation); for coarse movements, Tangible Bots
become useful only when several tangibles are controlled simultaneously. Participants
prefer Tangible Bots and find them less taxing than passive, non-motorized tangibles.
A second study focuses on usefulness by studying how electronic musicians use Tangible
Bots to create music with a tangible tabletop application. We conclude by discussing
the further potential of active tangibles, and their relative benefits over passive

devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and 3M's multi-touch displays, without requiring any
hardware modifications. TUIC simulates finger touches on capacitive displays using
passive materials and active modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects,
and can be used with multi-touch gestures simultaneously. TUIC consists of three approaches
to sense and track objects: spatial, frequency, and hybrid (spatial plus frequency).
The spatial approach, also known as 2D markers, uses geometric, multi-point touch
patterns to encode object IDs. Spatial tags are straightforward to construct and are
easily tracked when moved, but require sufficient spacing between the multiple touch
points. The frequency approach uses modulation circuits to generate high-frequency
touches to encode object IDs in the time domain. It requires fewer touch points and
allows smaller tags to be built. The hybrid approach combines both spatial and frequency
tags to construct small tags that can be reliably tracked when moved and rotated.
We show three applications demonstrating the above approaches on iPads and 3M's multi-touch
displays.},

is too limited. We propose that demonstrating behavior change is often infeasible
as well as unnecessary for a meaningful contribution to HCI research, especially when
in the early stages of design or when evaluating novel technologies. As an alternative,
we suggest that HCI contributions should focus on efficacy evaluations that are tailored
to the specific behavior-change intervention strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, conditioning)
embodied in the system and studies that help gain a deep understanding of people's

Pulmonary rehabilitation is effective in treating COPD. Rehabilitation, combining
physical exercise with education, is usually undertaken in hospital or clinic-based
groups led by a clinician. The support of the group is important. However, distance
of travel, and mobility and transport problems can mean that patients are unable to
participate. This paper describes a feasibility study to deliver a program to a group
of patients in their own homes, improving accessibility. A novel videoconferencing
system was installed in four patient's homes, connected to their TV and the Internet.
A physiotherapist delivered a pulmonary rehabilitation program, involving twice-weekly
exercise sessions for eight weeks. All were visible and audible to maintain the group-based
approach of the conventional program. The technology performed well, satisfaction
was high, and clinical improvements occurred in all patients, comparable to a conventional
program. Larger studies are warranted.},

investigated the interactions that occur in modern-day practice of software product
support. We present results from a multi-dimensional analysis of product support activities
at a leading design software company. We carried out a quantitative analysis of existing
support requests, a survey with product support specialists, and follow-up interviews
to understand the current practices in product support. In particular, we investigated
the utility of different multimedia formats that modern web-based support systems
enable. Our results showed that despite the value that these formats bring to support
tasks, support specialists still face bottlenecks in remotely resolving software problems.
We conclude by highlighting several opportunities in HCI for improving diagnosis and
resolution of software issues over the web.},

various other physical objects (wallets, bags, doors, pens, mugs, etc.). This paper
presents the Manual Multitasking Test, a test with 12 conditions emulating manual
demands of everyday multitasking situations. It allows experimenters to expose the
effects of design on "manual flexibility": users' ability to reconfigure the sensorimotor
control of arms, hands, and fingers in order to regain the high performance levels
they experience when using the device on its own. The test was deployed for pointing
devices on laptops and Qwerty keyboards of mobile devices. In these studies, we identified
facilitative design features whose absence explains, for example, why the mouse and
stylus function poorly in multi-object performance. The issue deserves more attention,
because interfaces that are nominally similar (e.g., "one-handed input") can vary
dramatically in terms of "ease of juggling".},

did influence multitasking performance, and moreover, non-redundant multimodal feedback
was more effective than no multimodality or redundant multimodality for tasks with
reasonable difficulty, e.g. when the number of jobs was more than four.},

scenario to examine how users manage deferrable interruptions in the presence of varying
time constraints. We found that while cognitive load did influence multitasking as
expected, the time constraints placed on the user also had a significant impact. In
particular, we observed three distinct strategies for addressing interruption: the
expected strategy of switching at low-load points, but also two other strategies of
continuing on after a low-load point or giving up at a high-load point. The presence
of the latter two strategies strongly suggests that users can adapt their multitasking
behavior with respect to the time constraints of the interrupting task.},

analyzing and designing for external interruptions. The causes of self-interruptions
are not well understood. In this paper we present an analysis of 889 hours of observed
task switching behavior from 36 individuals across three high-technology information
work organizations. Our analysis suggests that self-interruption is a function of
organizational environment and individual differences, but also external interruptions
experienced. We find that people in open office environments interrupt themselves
at a higher rate. We also find that people are significantly more likely to interrupt
themselves to return to solitary work associated with central working spheres, suggesting
that self-interruption occurs largely as a function of prospective memory events.
The research presented contributes substantially to our understanding of attention
and multitasking in context.},

helps analysts more consistently and accurately classify evidence and establish common
ground. We also find that managing and incentivizing participation is important for
analysts to progress from exploratory analysis to deeper analytical tasks. Finally,
we demonstrate that tags and links can help teams complete evidence gathering and

that those mechanisms need to scale dramatically to adequately support such work settings.
In this paper, we used data from five distinct large-scale projects from three different
companies to study the scale, range, and volatility of the coordination requirements
that emerged over time within those projects. Our results showed that coordination
requirements tend to be quite volatile, vary significantly in their magnitude across
project members and a significant proportion of the coordination requirements cut
across organizational and geographical boundaries. Furthermore, new coordination requirements
represent, on average, a third of the coordination requirements faced by a project
member on a monthly basis. The implications of these results for the design of collaborative

system called Kappan. It enables service providers and users to create hyperlinks

on the page if a hyperlink is to be created. We consider that utilizing the concept
of the search index makes markers unnecessary. Kappan associates indexed text areas
in a large number of books with supporting digital contents. The indexed text areas,
freely defined by service providers or users, are identified by subjecting images
of small areas of the printed page to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and extracting
from the text so recognized highly specific and efficient search keys. Traditional
text indexing methods must extract long character sequences from the partial image
in order to identify the area exactly given the sheer number of book pages. However,
considering that the average OCR error rate is more than 20 percent if the partial
image is captured by a camera-equipped cellular phone, it is highly probable that
many characters would be misrecognized and area identification would thus fail. In
contrast, our indexing method can extract area-specific clues using fewer characters
that can identify the area exactly even when the partial image is small and the extracted
text contains misrecognized characters. An experiment proves that our method can identify
the exact area from more than one million areas with the high accuracy rates of 99
percent and 96 percent for OCR error rates of 0 percent and 22 percent, respectively.},

abstract = {The workload needed for managing privacy and publicness in current social network
services (SNSs) is placed on individuals, yet people have few means to control what
others disclose about them. This paper considers SNS-users' concerns in relation to
online disclosure and the ways in which they cope with these both individually and
collaboratively. While previous work has focused mainly on individual coping strategies,
our findings from a qualitative study with 27 participants suggest that collaborative
strategies in boundary regulation are of additional importance. We present a framework
of strategies for boundary regulation that informs both theoretical work and design
practice related to management of disclosure in SNSs. The framework considers disclosure
as an interpersonal process of boundary regulation, in which people are dependent
on what others choose to disclose about them. The paper concludes by proposing design
solutions supportive of collaborative and preventive strategies in boundary regulation
that facilitate the management of disclosure online.},

better able to distinguish between privacy and non-privacy language, and is less context-dependent

independence and safety. We developed GoBraille, two related Braille-based applications

GoBraille is built on MoBraille, a novel framework that enables a Braille display
to benefit from many features in a smartphone without knowledge of proprietary, device-specific
protocols. Finally, we conducted user studies with blind people to demonstrate that
GoBraille enables people to travel more independently and safely. We also conducted
co-design with a deaf-blind person, finding that a minimalist interface, with short
input and output messages, was most effective for this population.},

that the apparatus could be used as a tactile notification mechanism. The other experiment
assessed the feasibility of using a cover-and-hold gesture on the wristwatch to obtain
numerical data tactually. Results from the numerosity experiment and feedback from
participants prompted us to redesign the cover-and-hold gesture to provide users with
additional control over the interaction. We qualitatively evaluated the redesigned
interaction by handing the prototype to users so that they could use it in a realistic
work environment. Taken together, results from the experiments and the validation
process indicate that a wrist accessory can be effectively used to perform discreet,
closed-loop, eyes-free interactions with a mobile device.},

different tactile feedback stimuli varied by 4 output delays and 4 vibration durations.
The results showed that the mean ranks of the stimuli differed significantly from
each other. The timing parameters of delay and duration interacted with each other,
for example, so that preference of certain vibration duration fluctuated in response
to different output delays. Using a very short time window (i.e., 10-453 ms) combining
both delay and duration parameters of the feedback could result either in favorable
or significantly less favorable subjective experience. The results suggest that a
preferred perception of tactile feedback from non-physical buttons requires careful
design and controlling of the timing parameters.},

two unintended benefits resulting from micro-negotiations. These findings lead us

clinician workarounds engendered by the adoption of a Computerized Prescribe Order
Entry (CPOE) system. Specifically, we investigated how adoption of computerized systems
may alter medical practice, order management in particular, as manifested through
the working-around behavior developed by doctors and nurses to accommodate the changes
in their day-to-day work environment. In this paper, we focus on clinicians' workarounds,
including those workarounds that gradually disappeared and those that have become
routinized. Further, we extend the CSCW concept of boundary object (to "assemblage")
in order to understand the workarounds created with CPOE system use and the changing
nature of clinical practices that are increasingly computerized.},

abstract = {Though data analysis tools continue to improve, analysts still expend an inordinate
amount of time and effort manipulating data and assessing data quality issues. Such
"data wrangling" regularly involves reformatting data values or layout, correcting
erroneous or missing values, and integrating multiple data sources. These transforms
are often difficult to specify and difficult to reuse across analysis tasks, teams,
and tools. In response, we introduce Wrangler, an interactive system for creating
data transformations. Wrangler combines direct manipulation of visualized data with
automatic inference of relevant transforms, enabling analysts to iteratively explore
the space of applicable operations and preview their effects. Wrangler leverages semantic
data types (e.g., geographic locations, dates, classification codes) to aid validation
and type conversion. Interactive histories support review, refinement, and annotation
of transformation scripts. User study results show that Wrangler significantly reduces
specification time and promotes the use of robust, auditable transforms instead of
manual editing.},

Second, we present a qualitative analysis of twelve in-depth, semi-structured, interviews
with Scratch participants on the subject of remixing and attribution. Results from
both studies suggest that automatic attribution done by technological systems (i.e.,
the listing of names of contributors) plays a role that is distinct from, and less
valuable than, credit which may superficially involve identical information but takes
on new meaning when it is given by a human remixer. We discuss the implications of
these findings for the designers of online communities and social media platforms.},

is: what surface features of an email draw attention to it? In this research, we examined
how top-level cues about an email's content influence attention to email. We describe
results from a think-aloud study examining people's stated rationale for prioritizing
certain emails over others. Based on these results and theory on curiosity, we conducted
an experiment examining how message importance, subject line specificity, workload
and personal utility influence attention to email. Results suggest that uncertainty
about message content at the inbox level increases the likelihood of attention to
a message. The influence of uncertainty diminishes, however, in the face of enhanced
task and personal utility cues and increased demand, suggesting that curiosity operates
in an intrinsic way in the email context. Our results have implications for intelligent
email system design, email client interfaces, and reducing email strain.},

and grammar in emails can be signs of phish. But a content analysis of a phishing
archive indicates that many such emails contain no obvious spelling or grammar mistakes
and often use convincing logos and letterheads. An online survey of 224 people finds
that although phish are detected approximately 80% of the time, those with logos are
significantly harder to detect. A qualitative interview study was undertaken to better
understand the strategies used to identify phish. Blind users were selected because
it was thought they may be more vulnerable to phishing attacks, however they demonstrated
robust strategies for identifying phish based on careful reading of emails. Finally
an analysis was undertaken of phish as a literary form. This identifies the main literary
device employed as pastiche and draws on critical theory to consider why security
based pastiche may be currently very persuasive.},
